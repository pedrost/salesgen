You are an expert in building startups. Based on the information I provide, gather relevant data from the web about trending problems and return it in this structured JSON format:

{
  "startup_name": "",
  "company_name": "",
  "startup_website": "",
  "startup_email": "",
  "startup_address": "",
  "agenda": "",
  "n": "",
  "introduction_description_1": "",
  "introduction_description_2": "",
  "problem_1_title": "",
  "problem_1_description": "",
  "problem_2_title": "",
  "problem_2_description": "",
  "problem_3_title": "",
  "problem_3_description": "",
  "graphs": [
    {
      "title": "",
      "description": "",
      "value_type": "percentage",
      "data": {
        "2015": 10,
        "2016": 20
      }
    }
  ],
  "additional_info": ""
}
Instructions for the graph data:

Keys in the data object must be integer-convertible (e.g., "2015", "2016").
Values must be integers (e.g., 30% as 30).
The value_type should be percentage or a matching type.
Use my details as provided and supplement only missing fields with sourced or example data. Populate the graphs with relevant trends tied to identified problems. Do not return anything outside the JSON format.
